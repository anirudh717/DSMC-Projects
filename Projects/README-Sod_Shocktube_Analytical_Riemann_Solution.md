1) The Sod_Shocktube_Analytical_Riemann_Solution.py is a One-dimensional shock tube simulator using Continuum Mechanics
2) The code solves Euler Equations for any given initial conditions of a shock tube
3) This solver can be used to visualize the macrostate distributions and the discontinuous jumps inside a shock tube.
